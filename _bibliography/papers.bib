  abstract     = {Climate change poses increasing risks to water security and public health, particularly in low-income
and climate-vulnerable regions. Effective adaptation requires scalable, low-cost interventions that im-
prove access to safe water while mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events such as droughts.
This study evaluates the effectiveness of a decentralized water policy as a climate adaptation strategy,
focusing on a large-scale rainwater harvesting program implemented in Brazil’s Semiarid region, the
Cisterns Program – an award-winning initiative aimed at building climate resilience in remote, under-
served communities. Using quasi-experimental methods and multiple data sources, the analysis finds
that access to household rainwater harvesting systems significantly reduces waterborne diseases, with
acute diarrheal infections declining by 168 cases per 100,000 residents — a 32% reduction in hospital-
izations and ambulatory care. Importantly, the intervention fully offsets the adverse health effects of
drought shocks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing community resilience. Mechanism analysis
suggests that education improves outcomes probably by increasing compliance and agency over water
use. These findings remain robust across multiple model specifications and placebo tests, emphasizing
the potential of low-cost interventions as viable climate adaptation strategies, particularly in regions
where large infrastructure projects may be impractical.

    abstract = {In the 2021–2022 school year, more books were banned in US school districts than in any previous year. Book banning and other forms of information censorship have serious implications for democratic processes, and censorship has become a central theme of partisan political rhetoric in the United States. However, there is little empirical work on the exact content, predictors of, and repercussions of this rise in book bans. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2,532 bans that occurred during the 2021–2022 school year from PEN America, combined with county-level administrative data, multiple book-level digital trace datasets, restricted-use book sales data, and a new crowd-sourced dataset of author demographic information, we find that (i) banned books are disproportionately written by people of color and feature characters of color, both fictional and historical, in children's books; (ii) right-leaning counties that have become less conservative over time are more likely to ban books than neighboring counties; and (iii) national and state levels of interest in books are largely unaffected after they are banned. Together, these results suggest that rather than serving primarily as a censorship tactic, book banning in this recent US context, targeted at low-interest children's books featuring diverse characters, is more similar to symbolic political action to galvanize shrinking voting blocs.},

abstract="In April 2020, the Brazilian Government established an Emergency Payment to minimize the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. This ad hoc policy strengthened the Brazilian welfare network to cover low-income, informal workers. During this period, social protection reached its historical peak in Brazil; however, to implement this massive policy, the federal government had to revisit its own institutional configuration and operations. This chapter presents an overview of this governance challenge to explain the implementation of the Emergency Payment. It assesses how the Brazilian federal government used ICT (information and communication technology) and large administrative databases to build a prompt response to an unprecedented emergency. We address this topic on two fronts. First, we develop a critical approach to discuss the limitations faced by traditional policy structures when dealing with a novel kind of public emergency. Secondly, we assess how governmental agencies managed to incorporate new technology-based routines in order to design and implement a new public policy. Most importantly, we focus on the adoption of ICT solutions in the implementation of the Emergency Payment. We argue that ICT solutions were pivotal to define (1) how many people were eligible to the new benefit; (2) how to reach these public; and (3) the design of a public policy. Besides, ICT solutions were essential in the governmental response since the usual implementation venues were blocked by lockdowns and other restrictive measures. However, these new technology-based routines interacted with preexisting infrastructure and policies. More precisely, we argue that ICT solutions require a set of informational, technological, and institutional conditions that shape the extent in which data can be helpful in designing and implementing rapid responses to large-scale crises. Moreover, we argue that, despite its positive impacts, ICT solutions may empower system-level bureaucrats and impose serious threats to accountability and democratic values.",
