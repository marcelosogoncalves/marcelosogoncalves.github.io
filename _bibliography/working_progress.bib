  abstract      ={How does climate adaptation affect fertility and birth outcomes? As global warming intensifies extreme droughts, access to water—already a challenge in many regions—is increasingly linked to reproductive decisions and pregnancy outcomes. Yet little is known about how household-level adaptation strategies shape fertility behavior or mitigate climate-related health risks. This paper studies Brazil’s “Cisterns Program,” a large-scale intervention providing low-cost rainwater harvesting systems to rural households in the drought-prone Semiarid region. Covering roughly 25% of the population, the program aims to smooth water consumption and increase resilience to climate shocks. We combine detailed administrative data on program rollout and household characteristics with Brazil’s complete birth registry from 2000–2022, covering over 5,000 municipalities and 510 microregions. Using this rich dataset, we analyze how access to cisterns affects birth outcomes, fertility timing, and exposure to waterborne diseases. We find that cisterns reduce the negative effects of droughts on birth weight, prematurity, and fetal death, while also lowering the incidence of diarrhea and intestinal illnesses. These effects are robust across specifications and suggest that household water security improves both maternal and child health under climate stress. Strikingly, we also detect a shift in the seasonality of conceptions in program areas—evidence that families adapt fertility planning to water availability. This behavioral response highlights a novel mechanism through which climate adaptation shapes demographic outcomes. Our findings underscore the potential of decentralized, low-cost infrastructure as an effective climate resilience strategy. In contexts where large-scale water systems are infeasible, household-level interventions like cisterns can protect vulnerable populations from the health and demographic impacts of climate change.},

  abstract     = {Forest certification is widely promoted as a tool for sustainable development, yet its socioeconomic impacts remain poorly understood. This paper evaluates the social and economic effects of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in Brazil’s natural forest sector—one of the most influential and understudied contexts globally. While much of the existing literature has focused on the environmental or commercial benefits of certification, we highlight a critical gap: the lack of rigorous evidence on how certification affects local communities and workers. We begin with a systematic review of over 30 international studies on the socioeconomic outcomes of forest certification, noting that only a handful employ quasi-experimental methods, and none focus on Brazil. We then present the first causal analysis of FSC's social impacts in the Brazilian Amazon, investigating outcomes such as household welfare, labor conditions, local governance, and Indigenous rights recognition. Drawing on multiple data sources and an original research design, we examine the mechanisms through which certification may generate social benefits—including wage standards, fair labor practices, and community participation. Our findings show that while FSC certification has potential to improve livelihoods and strengthen governance, its impacts are contingent on local institutional capacity and enforcement. In areas with weak state presence, certification may help fill governance gaps—but without robust oversight, its promises often go unrealized. The study contributes to the growing literature on sustainable resource governance by emphasizing the importance of aligning certification mechanisms with local social structures and accountability systems. By focusing on Brazil—the country with the highest number of FSC-certified hectares in the tropics—this study offers both a critical test of certification's social footprint and actionable insights for improving the design of certification schemes in developing countries.}
