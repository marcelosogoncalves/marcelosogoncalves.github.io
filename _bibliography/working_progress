  title        = {Access to Water and Climate Change: Adaptation, Fertility Decisions and Birth Outcomes in the Brazilian Semiarid Region},
  abstract      ={How does climate adaptation affect fertility and birth outcomes? As global warming intensifies extreme droughts, access to water—already a challenge in many regions—is increasingly linked to reproductive decisions and pregnancy outcomes. Yet little is known about how household-level adaptation strategies shape fertility behavior or mitigate climate-related health risks.
This paper studies Brazil’s “Cisterns Program,” a large-scale intervention providing low-cost rainwater harvesting systems to rural households in the drought-prone Semiarid region. Covering roughly 25% of the population, the program aims to smooth water consumption and increase resilience to climate shocks. We combine detailed administrative data on program rollout and household characteristics with Brazil’s complete birth registry from 2000–2022, covering over 5,000 municipalities and 510 microregions.
Using this rich dataset, we analyze how access to cisterns affects birth outcomes, fertility timing, and exposure to waterborne diseases. We find that cisterns reduce the negative effects of droughts on birth weight, prematurity, and fetal death, while also lowering the incidence of diarrhea and intestinal illnesses. These effects are robust across specifications and suggest that household water security improves both maternal and child health under climate stress.
Strikingly, we also detect a shift in the seasonality of conceptions in program areas—evidence that families adapt fertility planning to water availability. This behavioral response highlights a novel mechanism through which climate adaptation shapes demographic outcomes.
Our findings underscore the potential of decentralized, low-cost infrastructure as an effective climate resilience strategy. In contexts where large-scale water systems are infeasible, household-level interventions like cisterns can protect vulnerable populations from the health and demographic impacts of climate change.
