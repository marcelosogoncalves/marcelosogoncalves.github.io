I am a political economist working at the intersection of development, climate, and environmental governance. My research explores the institutional and behavioral determinants of sustainable development, with a particular emphasis on access to and use of natural resources, climate adaptation, and social equity in the Global South.

Drawing on insights from both political science and economics, I adopt an interdisciplinary approach to identify the conditions under which policies and programs generate environmental and development gains. My work combines causal inference, field experiments, and geospatial analysis to better understand challenges such as deforestation, climate resilience, and public service delivery.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Public Policy at Duke University and a <a href='https://jhfc.duke.edu/academics/vdhfellows/' target='_blank'>von der Heyden Global Fellow</a>. I also have over 15 years of experience as a <a href='https://anesp.org.br/english' target='_blank'>Specialist in Public Policy and Management (EPPGG)</a> in the Brazilian federal government, where I have collaborated on numerous policy evaluations and led initiatives in areas ranging from food security to racial equity and climate adaptation.
